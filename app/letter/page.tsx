            How's it going pineapple. You really thought I was not gonna ask you
            to be my valentine huh. Well, think again ðŸ˜¤. <br /> I am literally
            in love with you, so of course I was gonna ask you in the most extra
            way possible. I had a couple of ideas for this, like sending a
            letter (I even took sheets from office for this), send you some
            dessert with a note, or this, a full-on clone of NYT Games, but
            chandy themed. <br /> Now nothing actually happens when you say yes
            (or no ðŸ˜”), other than the satisfaction of knowing that in 2025, I
            am your Valentine, and you are mine ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°. So till I show up next
            weekend (Feb 14th 2025 if, for some reason, we come back to this
            website later on), enjoy some games I made for you. Ignore any and
            all bugs because, unlike me, nothing is perfect. <br /> I love you
            pookie, and so that begs the question....
