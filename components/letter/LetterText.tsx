      How's it going pineapple. You really thought I was not gonna ask you to be
      my valentine huh. Well, think again ðŸ˜¤. <br /> I am literally in love with
      you, so of course I was gonna ask you in the most extra way possible. I
      had a couple of ideas for this, like sending a letter (I even took sheets
      from office for this), send you some dessert with a note, or this, a
      full-on clone of NYT Games, but chandy themed. <br /> Now nothing actually
      happens when you say yes (or no ðŸ˜”), other than the satisfaction of
      knowing that in 2025, I am your Valentine, and you are mine ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°. So
      till I show up next weekend (Feb 14th 2025 if, for some reason, we come
      back to this website later on), enjoy some games I made for you. Ignore
      any and all bugs because, unlike me, nothing is perfect. <br /> I love you
      pookie, and so that begs the question....
